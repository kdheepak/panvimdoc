1. Choose `${VIMDOC_PROJECT_NAME}` and `${VIMDOC_PROJECT_DESCRIPTION}`.
1. Add the following to `./.github/workflows/panvimdoc.yml`:

>
    name: panvimdoc
    
    on: [push]
    
    jobs:
      docs:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        name: pandoc to vimdoc
        steps:
          - uses: actions/checkout@v2
          - name: panvimdoc
            uses: kdheepak/panvimdoc@main
            with:
              vimdoc: ${VIMDOC_PROJECT_NAME}
              description: ${VIMDOC_PROJECT_DESCRIPTION}
          - uses: stefanzweifel/git-auto-commit-action@v4
            with:
              commit_message: "Auto generate docs"
              branch: ${{ github.head_ref }}
<

1. `README.md` gets converted to `./doc/${VIMDOC_PROJECT_NAME}.txt` and committed
to the repo.


==============================================================================
3. Motivation                                           *panvimdoc-motivation*

Writing documentation is hard. Writing documentation in vimdoc for vim plugins
is an additional hassle. Making writing vim plugin documentation frictionless
is important.

Writing documentation in markdown and converting it to vimdoc can help toward
that goal. This way, plugin authors will have to write documentation just once
( for example, as part of the README of the project ), and the vim
documentation can be autogenerated.

Writing vim documentation requires conforming to a few simple rules. Although
`vimdoc` is not a well defined spec, vim does have some nice syntax
highlighting and features like tags and links when the text file is in `vimdoc`
compatible format and when `filetype=help` in vim. Also, typically, while vim
documentation are just plain text files, they are usually formatted well using
whitespace. See https://vimhelp.org/helphelp.txt.html#help-writing or
`@nanotree`’s project <https://github.com/nanotee/vimdoc-notes> for more
information. I think preserving these features and characteristics of vimdoc
for documentation of vim plugins is important.

Writing documentation in Markdown and converting it to vimdoc is not a novel
idea. `@mjlbach` <https://github.com/mjlbach> has already implemented a neovim
treesitter based markdown to vimdoc converter that works fairly well. See
mjlbach/babelfish.nvim <https://github.com/mjlbach/babelfish.nvim> for more
information. This approach is close to ideal. There are no dependencies (
except for the Markdown treesitter parser ). While it appears that the markdown
parser may cause crashes, I have not experienced any issues in my use. It is
neovim only but you can use this on github actions even for a vim plugin
documentation.

I found two other projects that do something similar, wincent/docvim
<https://github.com/wincent/docvim> and FooSoft/md2vim
<https://github.com/FooSoft/md2vim>. As far as I can tell, these projects are
actively maintained and may suit your need.

However, none of these projects use Pandoc. Pandoc Markdown supports a wide
number of features: See https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html for more information.
Most importantly, it supports a range of Markdown formats and flavors. And,
Pandoc has filters and a custom output writer that can be configured in lua.
Pandoc filters can extend the capability of Pandoc with minimal lua scripting,
and these are very easy to write and maintain too.

This project aims to write a specification of syntax in Pandoc Markdown, and to
take advantage of Pandoc filters and the custom output writer capability, to
convert a Markdown file to a vim documentation help file. This project provides
a reference implementation of the specification as well.

==============================================================================
4. Goals                                                     *panvimdoc-goals*


- Markdown file must be readable when the file is presented as the README on GitHub / GitLab / SourceHut etc.
- Markdown file converted to HTML using Pandoc must be web friendly and render appropriately (if the user chooses to do so).
- Vim documentation generated must support links and tags.
- Vim documentation generated should be aesthetically pleasing to view, in vim and as a plain text file.
    - This means using columns and spacing appropriately.
- Format of built in Vim documentation is used as guidelines but not as rules.


==============================================================================
5. Features                                               *panvimdoc-features*


- Autogenerate title for vim documentation
- Autogenerate table of contents
- Generate links and tags
- Support markdown syntax for tables
- Support raw vimdoc syntax where ever needed for manual control.
- Support including multiple Markdown files


==============================================================================
6. Specification                                     *panvimdoc-specification*

The specification is described in panvimdoc.md <./doc/panvimdoc.md> along with
examples. The generated output is in panvimdoc.txt <./doc/panvimdoc.txt>. The
reference implementation of the Pandoc lua filter is in panvimdoc.lua
<./scripts/panvimdoc.lua>. See entrypoint.sh <./entrypoint.sh> for how to use
this script, or check the |panvimdoc-usage| section.

If you would like to contribute to the specification, have feature requests or
opinions, please feel free to comment on this issue to start a discussion:
https://github.com/kdheepak/panvimdoc/issues/1.

==============================================================================
7. Usage                                                     *panvimdoc-usage*

>
    pandoc --metadata=project:${PROJECT} --lua-filter scripts/skip-blocks.lua --lua-filter scripts/include-files.lua -t scripts/panvimdoc.lua ${INPUT} -o ${OUTPUT}
<


The following are the metadata fields that the custom writer uses:


- `project` (String) _required_: This is typically the plugin name. This is prefixed to all generated tags. (e.g. `*project-heading*`)
- `toc` (Boolean) _optional_: Whether to generate table of contents or not. If not present, this value is set to `true`.
- `description` (String) _optional_: The description for your plugin. If not present, the `vimversion` and current date is used.
- `vimversion` (String) _optional_: The version vim / neovim that the plugin is targeting. If not present, the version of vim in the available environment is used.


Example:

>
    ---
    project: panvimdoc
    vimversion: Neovim v0.5.0
    toc: true
    ---
<


Generates the following:

>
    *panvimdoc.txt*         For Neovim v0.5.0          Last change: 2021 August 12
    
    ==============================================================================
    Table of Contents                                *panvimdoc-table-of-contents*
    
    1. panvimdoc                                             |panvimdoc-panvimdoc|
    2. Motivation                                           |panvimdoc-motivation|
    3. Goals                                                     |panvimdoc-goals|
    ...
<


Adding the `description`:

>
    ---
    project: panvimdoc
    description: pandoc markdown to vimdoc
    ---
<


generates the following:

>
    *panvimdoc.txt*                                      pandoc markdown to vimdoc
<


USING GITHUB ACTIONS                          *panvimdoc-using-github-actions*

Create an empty doc file:

>
    touch doc/${VIMDOC_PROJECT_NAME}.txt
    git commit -am "Add empty doc"
    git push
<


You don’t actually need the file, just the `doc` folder but it is easiest to
create a file.

Then add the following to `./.github/workflows/panvimdoc.yml`:

>
    name: panvimdoc
    
    on: [push]
    
    jobs:
      docs:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        name: pandoc to vimdoc
        steps:
          - uses: actions/checkout@v2
          - name: panvimdoc
            uses: kdheepak/panvimdoc@main
            with:
              vimdoc: ${VIMDOC_PROJECT_NAME}
              description: ${VIMDOC_PROJECT_DESCRIPTION}
              # the following are defaults on github actions
              # pandoc: "README.md"
              # toc: true
              # version: "NVIM v0.5.0"
          - uses: stefanzweifel/git-auto-commit-action@v4
            with:
              commit_message: 'Auto generate docs'
              branch: ${{ github.head_ref }}
<


Choose `VIMDOC_PROJECT_NAME` appropriately. This is usually the name of the
plugin or the documentation file without the `.txt` extension. For example, the
following:

>
          - name: panvimdoc
            uses: kdheepak/panvimdoc@main
            with:
              vimdoc: panvimdoc
              description: pandoc markdown to vimdoc
<


Will output a file `doc/panvimdoc.txt` and the vim help tag for it will be
`panvimdoc`. See `entrypoint.sh` <./entrypoint.sh> for exact shell command
executed.

For an example of how this is used, see one of the following workflows:


- kdheepak/panvimdoc <./.github/workflows/panvimdoc.yml>: doc/panvimdoc.txt <./doc/panvimdoc.txt>
- kdheepak/tabline.nvim <https://github.com/kdheepak/tabline.nvim/blob/main/.github/workflows/ci.yml>: doc/tabline.txt <https://github.com/kdheepak/tabline.nvim/blob/main/doc/tabline.txt>
- mcchrish/zenbones.nvim <https://github.com/mcchrish/zenbones.nvim/blob/main/.github/workflows/doc.yml>: doc/zenbones.txt <https://github.com/mcchrish/zenbones.nvim/blob/main/doc/zenbones.txt>
- shadmansaleh/lualine.nvim <https://github.com/shadmansaleh/lualine.nvim/blob/master/.github/workflows/docs.yml>: doc/lualine.txt <https://github.com/shadmansaleh/lualine.nvim/blob/master/doc/lualine.txt>

9. Specification                                     *panvimdoc-specification*

See ./panvimdoc.txt <./panvimdoc.txt> for generated output of this file.

EXTERNAL INCLUDES                                *panvimdoc-external-includes*

Use the following in your markdown file to include any other markdown file:

>
    ```{.include}
    README.md
    ```
<


The path of the file is with respect to the working directory where `pandoc` is
executed.

CODEBLOCKS                                              *panvimdoc-codeblocks*

>
    Multi line Code blocks are indented 4 spaces and
    
    are formatted
    
    appropriately with > and <.
<


Alternatively, you can use `vimdoc` as the language for the code block to write
raw text that will be inserted into the final document.

For example, the following:

>
    ```vimdoc
    You can use codeblocks that have language as `vimdoc` to write raw vimdoc.
    ```
<


will be rendered verbatim in the generated documentation.

This can be used to write any custom whitespace formatted documentation in the
generated vimdoc (for mappings, options etc).

Also see |panvimdoc-mappings| for a Markdown friendly way to write
documentation for mappings.

==============================================================================
10. Title                                                    *panvimdoc-title*

The first line of the documentation that is generated will look something like
this:

>
    *panvimdoc.txt*    For VIM - Vi IMproved 8.1       Last change: 2021 August 11
<


==============================================================================
11. Heading                                                *panvimdoc-heading*

Main headings are numbered.

SUB HEADING 2                                        *panvimdoc-sub-heading-2*

Sub headings are upper cased heading.

Notice that both headings and subheadings have tags.

SUB HEADING 3 ~

Sub headings are upper cased, but do not have tags. They are also not included
in the TOC. They are suffixed with `~` which highlights as **bold** text when
the file is viewed on GitHub.

MARKDOWN LINKS                                      *panvimdoc-markdown-links*

You can use markdown links in vimdoc. For example, see the |panvimdoc-links|
section in the generated vim document.

>
    You can link to the tags by using [sub heading 2](#sub-heading-2).
<


This way, any links will work in markdown README on GitHub or on the web using
anchors AND will work as tags and links in vimdoc. The anchors are simply
dropped in vimdoc inline. The onus is on the documentation writer to choose the
correct anchor for the appropriate Markdown link.

In vim doc tags are created when anchors to the internal document are used. If
the target is an external link, the link is populated in a separate
autogenerated |panvimdoc-links| section.

If the external link is to the neovim documentation, an internal vim link is
generated. See |cursorcolumn| or |`completeopt`| as an example. This is
excluded from the links section.

Lastly, if the markdown text is a url, the link is not added to the links
section and instead is placed inline.

MAPPINGS                                                  *panvimdoc-mappings*

While you can use codeblocks with the language `vimdoc` to insert text in the
generated vimdoc, it can be useful to have a markdown friendly way to write
documentation for mappings.

Any markdown header of level 4 will be considered as a special header. This can
be used to generate documentation of mappings. All of the content in curly
braces `{...}` that is part of the header is dropped and a tag is created.

For example, the level 4 heading and the contents of the section is as follows:

>
    #### abc{xyz}
    
    Docstring for abc {xyz}.
<


Notice that the tag `*projectName-abc` is generated for you:

Additionally, content in square brackets `[...]` is also dropped for creating
the tag name.

The heading `### :[range]Command` becomes the tag `*projectName-:Command*`.

See following headings as examples:

                                                                *panvimdoc-pv*

pv{motion}                             Command that operates over {motion}
                                       moved.


                                                               *panvimdoc-pvd*

pvd                                    Command that takes [count] lines.


                                        *panvimdoc-:CommandName* *CommandName*

:[range]CommandName                    Command that operates over [range].


You can use `{doc=AdditionalTag}` to generate one additional tag for each
header.

                                                                *panvimdoc-pv*

{Visual}pv                             Command that operates over highlighted
                                       lines.


TABLE                                                        *panvimdoc-table*

Support for markdown tables is also available:

MARKDOWN ONLY CONTENT                        *panvimdoc-markdown-only-content*

Content that needs to be presented only in Markdown can be inside
`panvimdoc-ignore-{start/end}` blocks:

>
    <!-- panvimdoc-ignore-start -->
    
    <details>
        <summary>Vimdoc Ignored Section</summary>
    
    This section will ignored when generating the vimdoc file.
    This will only show up in the Markdown file.
    
    </details>
    
    <!-- panvimdoc-ignore-end -->
<


The convenient feature of using `panvimdoc-ignore-{start/end}` blocks is that
it is not rendered in HTML, keeping your README rendered on GitHub more
readable. If you want to see examples of this, see the raw markdown version of
this file.

You must leave new line spaces before and after a comment tag. For example,
**do not** do this:

>
    <!-- panvimdoc-ignore-start -->
    ![screenshot](./gif.gif)
    <!-- panvimdoc-ignore-end -->
<


because it may cause the rest of your document to be ignored. Do this instead:

>
    <!-- panvimdoc-ignore-start -->
    
    ![screenshot](./gif.gif)
    
    <!-- panvimdoc-ignore-end -->
<


DETAILS AND SUMMARY                            *panvimdoc-details-and-summary*

You can even use `<details>` and `<summary>` tags for your README.md.

Summary ~

This section is the details.

The `html` tags are dropped and the following output is generated in the vimdoc
file.

>
    Summary ~
    
    This section is the details.
<


If you are using html `<b> ... </b>` tags, use them on new lines. Inline bold
tags ~ will have a `~` appended to the text and that may not be what you want.

KEYBOARD HTML TAG                                *panvimdoc-keyboard-html-tag*

Use `<kbd>CMD + o</kbd>` in markdown, for example CMD + o.
